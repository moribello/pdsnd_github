### Project Title
Bikeshare Data Analysis tool

### Description
This project analyzes bike share data from three major cities
    - Washington DC
    - Chicago
    - New York City
NOTE: User must choose from one of these three cities to continue. Users will be prompted to select from the list of existing cities.

The user will be prompted to select a city, a month to filter by (or "all" to skip filtering by month), and a day of the week to filter by (or "all" to skip filtering by day of week).
NOTE: As there are a limited number of months available users will be prompted to select another month if data for that month is unavailable.

The following data will be returned based on the user's selections:
    - Most popular month for rentals
    - Most popular day of week for rentals
    - Most common hour of day for rentals
    - Most popular start, end, and combination of stations
    - Total and average trip durations
    - User types, gender, and birth year

Once the above data is returned users will be able to view the complete row data 5 rows at a time. To view this data enter "y" when prompted. To quit the program enter "no" at the "Would you like to restart?" prompt.
